    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a beginner programmer with a passion for learning new things. I am currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am excited to see what I can create with these technologies. I am also interested in learning other programming languages, such as Python and Java.

      This website showcases my work as a developer. It includes a variety of projects that I have worked on, from simple to complex. I hope that this website will give you a good overview of my skills and abilities.</p>
